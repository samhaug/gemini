**********************************************************************

To compile the programs just type 'make' if you are on a Linux-Pc AND
you have 'f2c'. If this is not the case, edit the makefiles in the
directories 'Gemini', 'Dispec' and 'Totido' according to your
equipment.

GEMINI stands for Green's function of the Earth by MInor Integration.
Actually, GEMINI consists of three separate programs, sharing the work
for computing seismograms:
	GEMINI
	DISPEC
	TOTIDO

Purpose of the separate programs
--------------------------------
GEMINI does the main work. It numerically solves the equation of
motion (EM), or rather, the systems of ordinary differential equations
(SODEs), derived from the EM. The results are combined to the Green's
coefficients (GCs) and stored on disk.

DISPEC computes the spectrum for vertical & horizontal displacement.
To this purpose, the GCs are read in and multiplicated with the source
function.  Afterwards, the sum over spherical harmonics is performed
and the resulting spectrum is stored on disk.

TOTIDO does a back transform to the time domain by a Fast Fourier
Transformation.  Filters (high/low pass) can be applied, and there is
a switch to choose between displacement/velocity/acceleration
seismograms.

Required data files for running the programs
--------------------------------------------
GEMINI needs two files supplying data for operation. One of these must
contain the earth model in a special format. Refer to the example
files IASP91 and STUTPREM/SPREMANI.  The other file must contain the
upper and lower limits for the degrees l of the spherical harmonics.
For some selected frequencies the upper and the lower limits have to
be given. Usually, the lower limit is zero and we do not recommend to
change this, because of ugly truncation effects in the resulting
seismograms.  The frequencies must be listed in increasing order.  The
limits for other frequencies are found by linear inter-/extrapolation.
In the first line of the file, the first integer must tell the number
of the following frequencies. 

DISPEC needs the degree limit file as well, the model parameter,
needed for moment tensor sources, are handed over in the GC file.  The
source parameters have to be supplied in an ASCII file with Harvard
catalog format (CMT). We provide a few example files to enable you to
check the format and content. Output of DISPEC is the velocity
spectrum written out in the binary file 'spec3k'.

TOTIDO reads 'spec3k' and allows manipulations of the spectrum, e.g.
filtering or time shifting. The parameters required for these
operations are read in interactively. The time series are written to
the file 'seismogr'.

Running GEMINI 
****************
Starting the program GEMINI, it will ask you first to type in its 
running parameters. We recommend to use the driver file 'gemini.sc' to
change those parameters, and executing 'gemini.sc' after that.
Detailed explanations are given there.


Format of the GEMINI output file 
----------------------------------
GEMINI stores its results in UNFORMATTED binary files.
The header consists of useful information. See the source code for
its contents. Further records are stored after the GCs for each
frequency have been computed.
In order to save disk space all data are stored in single precision.

Running DISPEC
***************
See the driver file disp.sc.

Format of the DISPEC output file 
----------------------------------
The spectra  DISPEC generates, are stored as binary files 'spec3k' 
for all three components of the displacement. 

Running TOTIDO
****************
See the driver file 'to.sc'.

Format of TOTIDO output file
-----------------------------
The time series, TOTIDO generates, and the filtered spectrum are
written into an ASCII file named 'seismogr'. The first two lines are
info lines with source and receiver parameters, followed by the data
columns: The first column contains the time in seconds, the following
three columns are the Upward-, North-south- and East-West-components.
one the amplitude in nm/s^2 (acceleration), nm/s (velocity) or nm
(displacement).

To calculate seismograms run the programs in the following order:

      1.    'gemini' via driver file 'gemini.sc'
      2.    'dispec' via driver file 'disp.sc'
      3.    'totido' via driver file 'to.sc'
