This file contains a brief description of the format used in the ASCII 
version of the Harvard centroid-moment tensor (CMT) catalog. The original
description of the CMT method can be found in:

Dziewonski, Chou, and Woodhouse, JGR, 86, 2825-2852, 1981.
Dziewonski and Woodhouse, JGR, 88, 3247-3271, 1983.

All of the moment tensor solutions have been published in Physics
of the Earth and Planetary Interior, and new solutions are published
there as quarterly reports. These reports also contain descriptions
of various enhancements to the original algorithm, 
including the incorporation of laterally
heterogeneous earth models and the use of broad band data 
for depth determination.

          centroid latitude, longitude and depth, each with standard error.
